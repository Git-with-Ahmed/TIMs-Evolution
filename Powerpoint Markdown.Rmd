## TIM4

- TIMD4_HUMAN
- T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 4
- 378 AA in length
- PS binding receptor expressed on APCs

## TIM4 Domain and Evolution

- Igv Domain containing protein
- Orthologs with significant homology present in vertebrates (42% Homology with Zebra Fish timd4; Alliance of Genome)
- No significant homology with invertebrates (C. elegans, and Drosophila; Blast)
- Igv Domain containing proteins are present in invertebrates
